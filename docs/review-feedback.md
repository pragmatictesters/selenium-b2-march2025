### Introducing Properties for Dependency Versions
Managing dependency versions directly within the pom.xml file can lead to inconsistencies and difficulties when updating versions. 
A best practice is to define version numbers as properties in the <properties> section, which makes maintenance easier and more consistent.


#### Advantages of Using Properties
1. Consistency: Easily update versions from a single location.
2. Readability: Clearly see which versions are used for each dependency group.
3. Automation: Simplifies the process when automating version updates through CI/CD.
